S2020_2021 English Premier League Exploratory Data Analysis


The English Premier League is the top level of competition in English football (Soccer). It is widely regarded as one of the most competitive and is one of the most watched sports competitions in the world. Each season typically lasts from mid-August to mid-May (with the exception of the 2019/2020 season, which was postponed for three months due to COVID-19). Each season 20 teams compete for the Premier League trophy, as well as for the top four spots. Then the top four teams will automatically be eligible for the next season of the Champions League (which is one of the most prestigious football tournaments not just in Europe but also in the world).
